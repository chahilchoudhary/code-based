# code-based Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Video Comments

Advanced Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Video Comments Overview This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on code-mixed video comments using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. The goal is to accurately classify sentiments in a challenging multilingual context, specifically in video comments that mix languages.

Features Custom Dataset Creation: A dataset was created from scratch, consisting of code-mixed video comments, which are typically challenging to analyze due to the mix of languages. NLP Pipeline: A robust NLP pipeline was developed, including preprocessing steps such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization, to ensure the data was prepared for effective model training. Machine Learning Models: Implemented traditional machine learning models, including Random Forest, to establish a baseline for sentiment classification. Deep Learning Models: Applied advanced deep learning models, including LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM), to capture the complex contextual information in code-mixed text. Performance Optimization: Fine-tuned models using hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy and generalization across different subsets of the data.
